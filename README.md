# Project Title: Digital Bank Application

## This initiative was executed as part of the Full Stack JavaScript course, overseen by OneBitCodeâ€”an esteemed educational institution. The primary objective of this project was to enhance participants' proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming within the realm of JavaScript.

## The project centered around simulating the operational tasks of a digital bank system, encompassing functions such as deposits, transfers, and loans within a bank account. These tasks were intricately linked to account management, user interactions, and predefined installment processes. The focus was on creating a realistic simulation of a digital banking environment, emphasizing the application of Object-Oriented Programming principles.
